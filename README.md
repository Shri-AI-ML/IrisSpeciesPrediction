# Iris Dataset Classification

This project demonstrates the training of a machine learning model on the famous Iris dataset, achieving an accuracy of 96%

# Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
In this project, a classification model is trained on the Iris dataset to identify the species of iris flower based on these features.

# Features

Loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset
Training a classification model (e.g., decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, or any algorithm you used)
Evaluating the model's accuracy on test data
Achieves a high accuracy of 96%, demonstrating an effective model
